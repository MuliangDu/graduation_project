# Thermal Semantic Segmentation using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Unpaired RGB and Thermal Images
Thermal cameras interpret the captured scene by sensing the temperature of the objects, enabling thermal cameras to perceive barely visible objects in particular situations, such as poor illuminating and foggy environments. This motivates autonomous driving systems to include thermal cameras in the suite of the sensors, which compensates for the over-reliance of conventional RGB cameras on visible light. In recent years,
a decent amount of researches pursued semantic segmentation tasks using RGB imaging, which aims to provide a class label to each pixel in an image and which requires costly annotation work. However, there has been little discussion on semantic segmentation using thermal imaging. Moreover, few relevant datasets have been published. Therefore, this work aims to train a semantic segmentation model using thermal imaging with an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method. Our UDA approach consists of two stages: a) unpaired image-to-image translation; b) selftraining with prototypical pseudo label denoising. Comprehensive experiments show our method can significantly improve the performance compared to without domain adaptation.
